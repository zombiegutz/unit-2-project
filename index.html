    <h2 class="text"> "When I went to a Christian college, there were very gender-specific dress/appearance codes. One
      time, I got in
      trouble for going to class with wet hair because it could make the boys 'think about me in the shower.' Women also
      weren't allowed to wear pajama pants to class, to avoid male students 'thinking about them in bed.' But the guys
      could come to class in whatever the hell they wanted, and it was totally fine."<h2>
